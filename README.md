Simple program made for artifical neural networks classes. Program using 10 perceptrons from 0 to 9 (every perceptron is responsible for recognize one digit, eg. 0 for 0, 1 for 1 etc.) after learning is able to recognize digit which you can provide by fire pixels on prepared 7x5 grid. For learning I used basic algorithm with pocket.
